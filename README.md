## Boilerplate for building a web app using React.js,Express.js,Redux & Webpack!

Use following steps to run the application - 

1. To run the app first clone the app to your local machine. Next, open the app folder in Terminal and enter the following command-
`$ npm install`

2. Next enter the following command to run the webpack build - 
`$ npm run webpack`
The webpack will now bundle all the resources required by the app and will spit a file named bundle.js.

3. Finally run the following command to spin the server and start the app (visit http://localhost:3000/ to view it) -
`$ npm run server`

This project provides a sample boilerplate code for quickly prototyping your own **React** web-app with preconfigured settings for **Express server and Webpack**. It includes an example of a simple counter app that uses **redux** for state management. 

Though ***redux*** might be an overkill for such a simple application, the project given a good idea of how all of these technologies work together in conjunction.

Feel free to use this project to kick start your React development using this ready to deploy boilerplate project.
